# Safari sound issue

This example works in native Mac and the web demo works in Chrome and Firefox
for Mac. But Safari and iOS doesn't seem to load the sound properly.

## Error

```
[Error] Failed to decode audio buffer â€“ null
	(anonymous function) (mq_js_bundle.js:3:10938)
[Error] Unhandled Promise Rejection: EncodingError: Decoding failed
	(anonymous function)
